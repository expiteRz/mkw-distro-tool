# mkw-distro-tool

The tool is to make a **distribution** (also called **CT Pack**) for Mario Kart Wii

Currently [Wiimms SZS Tools](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_SZS_Tools) is needed for patching any necessary files.

To create a distribution included Nintendo tracks, you need to prepare the original Mario Kart Wii ISO/WBFS and install [Wiimms ISO Tools](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_ISO_Tools) to extract ISO/WBFS.

The goal is finally to make it easy-to-use to create distributions but without any external tools like [Wiimms SZS Tools](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_SZS_Tools)
